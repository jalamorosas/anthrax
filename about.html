I hope to pursue a STEM career in either automotive mechanical engineering of biomedical engineering so I am excited to spend five weeks studying Biology, Mathematics, Design Thinking, Computer Science, Economics and Marketing while collaborating with teammates to develop a project proposing a treatment, prevention, or cure of a communicable disease that is a public health problem.</p></div></div>

SMASH@Wharton is a summer STEM academy for underserved, highly able students from the Philadelphia area, so I am super excited to be here with other scholars who share my interests in STEM in general and programming in particular! The team that I am working with is developing a device to test for Anthrax which can be used by letter carriers and mailroom personnel. I am particularly proud of the website that our team is developing for this project. Our website utilizes HTML, CSS and Javascript! When I am not busy writing code I can be found playing soccer with my club team.</p></div></div>
