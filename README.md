# anthrax
This was my final project for my first year of SMASH academy. I was the main designer and developer of this website and its probably the website I'm most proud of
making so far. It was because of this website that I won the excellence in STEM award at SMASH. The website contains an embed of our prezi presentation and a mock 
shop where we would sell our prototype anthrax kits if we were a real company. I was so proud of our group for making such a great project.
